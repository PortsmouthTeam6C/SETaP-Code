Welcome to SYNERGY'S Documentation
========================================
Synergy is a project made to improve the experience of searching for and joining societies at your university.
Synergy was made for SETaP Coursework by Team 6C.

Overview
==========
Synergy gives universities a platform for their societies. It allows for students to search for societies, join societies, send messages to their societies, join society events and manage their overall experience with all their chosen university societies.

Synergy also allows for admin accounts for society management, creation and deletion. This is intended to be used by university employees and student unions.
